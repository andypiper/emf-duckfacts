# Duck Facts

An app for [TiDAL](https://badge.emfcamp.org/), the badge of [Electromagnetic Field 2022](https://emfcamp.org).

Some facts about ducks. Inspired by [@emfducks](https://twitter.com/emfducks) and (breaking news!) [endorsed by them](https://twitter.com/EmfDucks/status/1533871976422547459)!

Uses information from the [duck facts API](https://03vpefsitf.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod/) (and wants to be on wifi to grab facts from there)

Installable from the [Hatchery](https://2022.badge.emfcamp.org/projects/duckfact).
